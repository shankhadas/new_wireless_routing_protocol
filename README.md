Applications of low energy devices are increasing prominently in a variety of areas like smart energy, smart home etc. However as the network topology in these applications becomes more complicated, the devices will encounter bottlenecks of speed, concurrency and propagation time. The failure rate of transmission might also increase due to the increased collision. Sensor battery life is also drastically reduced due to a higher number of attempts by each sensor for successful transmission. The very essence of Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (LoWPAN) is does threatened.
