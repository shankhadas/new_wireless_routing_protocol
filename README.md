Applications of low energy devices are increasing prominently in a variety of areas like smart energy, smart home etc. However as the network topology in these applications becomes more complicated, the devices will encounter bottlenecks of speed, concurrency and propagation time. The failure rate of transmission might also increase due to the increased collision. Sensor battery life is also drastically reduced due to a higher number of attempts by each sensor for successful transmission. The presence of Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (LoWPAN) is does threatened.
This dissertation deals with the 802.15.4 protocol for star topology. Usually, in a 802.15.4 star network, the Full Function Device (FFD) is very busy and the Reduced Function Device (RFD) nodes observe the Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA/CA or CSMA-CA) paths and avoid the collisions and increase the percentage of success or transmission of packets. We propose an alternate star network in which the FFD at the center will also have an alternate standby receiver.
For the new proposed protocol, the 802.15.4 protocol needs to be tweaked and the following metrics need to be compared between both the approaches. Later on, an initial theoretical understanding will be developed with the waiting line system/queuing system.
